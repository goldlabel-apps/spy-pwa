# Spy

> A Progressive Web App with React &amp; Material UI

The thing we really want from the whole thing is the ability to quickly and easily get accurate data from the Spy. We do that by using an App. The app is just a website, really. It can be used on your phone, your computer/wherever you like

What the app does is to connect to the API and subscribe to real time updates to the data for that Spy. Every time a Spy tings, the app is automagically updated

Depending on your ting time, the data should go back in time for as long as a week. Graphs and stuff are good for showing changes over time. D3 is the daddy of javascript graphs

- Temperature
	Temp right now as indicated on a scale of optimum Hemp. Largeifyable
- Humidity
	Humidity right now as indicated on a scale of optimum Humidity 
- Light
	hours of light in the past 24, 12, hour
	over past week (can we easily see a 12/12 flowering cycle?)
- Moisture
	Soil sensors (if used)
	water them and look. Should be 100%. Wait several days and make sure the value drops. Use the time enlarger to see how quickly that happens. Then you know
- Air Pressure
	Not particularly useful? Unless it is. Anyway, itâ€™s there
